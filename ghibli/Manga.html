            Miyazaki never abandoned his childhood dream of becoming a manga artist. His professional career in this medium begins in 1969 with the publication of his manga interpretation of Puss in Boots. Serialized in 12 chapters in the Sunday edition of Tokyo Shimbun, from January to March 1969. Printed in colour and created for promotional purposes in conjunction with his work on Yabuki's animated film.
           
            That same year pseudonymous serialization started of Miyazaki's original manga People of the Desert. Created in the style of illustrated stories he read, in boys' magazines and Tankōbon volumes, while growing up, such as Soji Yamakawa's Shōnen ōja (少年王者 shōnen ōja?) and in particular Tetsuji Fukushima's Evil Lord of the Desert (沙漠の魔王 Sabaku no maō?). Miyazaki's Desert People is a continuation of that tradition and a precursor for his own creations  Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind  and The Journey of Shuna. In People of the Desert expository text is presented separately from the monochrome artwork with additional text balloons inside the panels for dialogue. 26 chapters were serialized in Boys and Girls Newspaper (少年少女新聞 Shōnen shōjo shinbun?) between September 12, 1969 (Issue 28) and March 15, 1970 (issue 53). Published under the pseudonym Akitsu Saburō (秋津三朗 ?). His manga interpretation of Animal Treasure Island, made in conjunction with Ikeda's animated film, was serialized in the Sunday edition of Tokyo Shimbun from January to March 1971. (13 chapters, in colour).


            His major work in the manga format is Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, created intermittently from 1981 through 1994. In Japan it was first serialized in Tokuma Shoten's monthly magazine Animage and has been collected, after slight modification, in seven tankōbon volumes, spanning 1060 pages. Nausicaä has been translated and released outside Japan and has sold millions of copies worldwide. On March 11, 1984 the anime film of the same title was released. The characters and settings of manga and film have their common roots in the Image Boards Miyazaki created to visualise his ideas in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The anime is an amalgamation of the first sixteen chapters of the manga. In the manga Miyazaki explores the themes at greater length and in greater depth with a greater host of characters and a more expansive universe which he continued to expand over an additional decade after the release of the film. Nausicaä panels were printed monochrome in sepia toned ink. To advance the narrative, text balloons and artwork are employed almost exclusively.
           
                 other works include the journey of shuna, released, in 1983, and hikōtei jidai, first serialized in model graphix in 1989. both were created in watercolour. the latter was the basis of porco rosso. hayao miyazaki's daydream data notes contains short manga, essays and samples from miyazaki's sketchbooks, bundled in book form in 1992.shuna, in 1987, and selections from daydream data notes, in 1995, were dramatised for radio broadcast.
                 in october 2006, a trip to tynemouth was published in japan. the book contains a translated collection of three of the young adult short stories written by robert westall, who grew up in world war ii england. the most famous story, first published in a collection called break of dark, is titled blackham's wimpy, the name of a vickers wellington bomber featured in the story. the nickname comes from the character j. wellington wimpy from the popeye comics and cartoons (the wellington was named for arthur wellesley, 1st duke of wellington, victor over napoleon). miyazaki worked as editor, provided the cover illustrations and created short manga for addition in the book. miyazaki based his manga and illustrations on westall's short stories, including parts about blackham's bomber, and added fictional elements of his own. depicting a narrator, as an anthropomorphised pig, who has an imaginary meeting with westall, depicted as a terrier, on a trip to tynemouth. westall's short stories themselves are translated into japanese but are otherwise left unchanged for this publication.
                 in early 2009, miyazaki began writing a new manga called kaze tachinu (風立ちぬ the wind rises?), telling the story of mitsubishi a6m zero fighter designer jiro horikoshi. the manga was first published in two issues of the model graphix magazine, published on february 25 and march 25, 2009. miyazaki ultimately required 9 chapters to finish the manga. the last chapter was published in the january 2010 issue of the magazine.
                 following his announced retirement, it was revealed during an nhk tv broadcast that miyazaki was serializing a currently untitled samurai manga while charging the magazine no fee for his artwork.></p>
